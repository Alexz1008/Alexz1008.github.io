          <p>The first programming language I learned. I am very comfortable with Java and am confident that I can translate that to a professional environment. The gaming server that I co-own also runs exclusively on Java.</p>

          <h3>C</h3>
          <img src="./images/C.png">
          <p>I am capable with C and have a deep understanding of it, having learned how it interacts with assembly code. Though it is not my strongest language, I am still easily able to perform up to par with this language.<p>

          <h3>Swift</h3>
          <img src="./images/swift.png">
          <p>I have a basic understanding of Swift. Though I am still learning, the knowledge I have was enough to be accepted into an external set of courses called CodePath, and as such I expect to improve my abilities in this language very quickly.</p>
